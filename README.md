# Project Summary
 
A burgeoning pharmaceutical company. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. 
In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 
a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a Data Analyst, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. 
In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. 
Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. 
Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this I used the following tools:
- Pandas library from Python
- Jupyter notebook as development environment
- Matplotlib library for graphs and visualizations.

Generated the following visualizations:
- Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
- Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
- Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
- Created a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
- Included 3 observations about the results of the study. Used the visualizations i have generated from the study data as the basis for my observations.
